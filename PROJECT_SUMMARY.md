# BudgetBuddy - Supabase Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What We've Accomplished

âœ… **Successfully migrated from Google Sheets + Firebase to Supabase**
âœ… **Created a complete Supabase service layer**
âœ… **Added mock service for testing without credentials**
âœ… **Updated all UI components to work with new backend**
âœ… **Created database schema for transactions**
âœ… **Added comprehensive setup documentation**

## Project Structure

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart              # App entry point with Supabase initialization
â”œâ”€â”€ config.dart            # Supabase credentials configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ supabase_service.dart  # Supabase database operations
â”œâ”€â”€ mock_service.dart      # Mock service for testing
â”œâ”€â”€ homepage.dart          # Main UI with transaction management
â”œâ”€â”€ transaction.dart       # Transaction widget component
â”œâ”€â”€ top_card.dart          # Summary card component
â”œâ”€â”€ plus_button.dart       # Add transaction button
â””â”€â”€ loading_circle.dart    # Loading indicator

supabase_schema.sql        # Database schema for Supabase

## Current Status

ðŸŸ¢ **The app is ready to run!**

- **Demo Mode**: Currently running with mock data (no Supabase credentials needed)
- **Production Mode**: Ready to connect to Supabase once credentials are added

## How to Use

### Demo Mode (Current)
The app is currently running in demo mode with sample data. You can:
- View sample transactions
- Add new transactions (stored in memory)
- See income/expense calculations
- Test the UI functionality

### Production Mode (Supabase)
To connect to Supabase:

1. **Create a Supabase project** (see `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`)
2. **Update `lib/config.dart`** with your credentials:
   ```dart
   static const String supabaseUrl = 'https://your-project.supabase.co';
   static const String supabaseAnonKey = 'your-anon-key';
   ```
3. **Run the SQL schema** in your Supabase dashboard
4. **Restart the app** - it will automatically switch to Supabase mode

## Features

### âœ… Implemented
- **Transaction Management**: Add income/expense transactions
- **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic income/expense totals
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design
- **Data Persistence**: Supabase database storage
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to mock service
- **Cross-platform**: Works on web, mobile, and desktop

### ðŸ”„ Ready for Enhancement
- User authentication
- Transaction categories
- Date filtering
- Export functionality
- Charts and analytics
- Budget goals and alerts

## Running the App

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on web (recommended for testing)
flutter run -d chrome

# Run on mobile (if Android/iOS setup is complete)
flutter run
```

## Database Schema

The app uses a simple but scalable schema:

```sql
transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('income', 'expense')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Supabase** following the setup guide
2. **Test with real data** by adding your credentials
3. **Deploy to production** when ready
4. **Add more features** like user accounts, categories, etc.

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase credentials are correct
3. Ensure the database schema is properly set up
4. Check the `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for troubleshooting tips
